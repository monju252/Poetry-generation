## ✨ Why Use AI for Poetry?

Poets know the struggle: words dancing just out of reach. AI can help you:
- 🧠 Brainstorm fresh metaphors and imagery  
- 📝 Generate structured forms (haiku, sonnet, limerick…)  
- 🎯 Refine meter, rhyme, tone, or theme  
- 💡 Break through writer’s block with new angles  
- 🎨 Collaborate with AI as creative duet partners

Use thoughtfully—AI is a muse, not a replacement.
